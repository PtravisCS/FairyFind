        <center>Fairy Tale Find</center>
        <p class='body'> 
	  My fairy tale find is a series of references to the Three Billy Goats Gruff fairy tale found in the Bethesda video game series, <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>. In the fourth and fifth installments of this
	  series, <i>Oblivion</i> and <i>Skyrim</i> respectively there are a series of events that attempt to make humourous references to the Norwegian fairy tale. For those who are unfamiliar with the tale
	  of Three Billy Goats Gruff the basic tale goes as such: There are three goats, a smallest (or younges) a middling goat, and a largest (or eldest). These three goats make a decision to leave their current
	  meadow which is low on foodstuffs and cross the river to get to a greener pasture. Thus the three goats start off on their journey each in order of age (or size) of youngest (or smallest) to eldest 
	  (or largest). When the first goat goes to cross the bridge he is set upon at once by a troll from under the bridge, this troll expresses its desire to eat the first goat. The first goat entices the troll
	  saying that "if you let me pass, a larger goat shall come that you may then eat", the greedy troll agrees and permits the goat to pass. This same scene with minor variations passes for the middling goat.
	  finally the largest goat comes to the bridge and when the troll goes to eat him, the larget goat butts him off of the bridge killing him. Thus everyone lives happily ever after. In my fairy tale
	  finds there are two seperate references to this tale. The first one occurs in <i>Oblivion</i>. In Oblivion when traveling north from the in game town of Leyawiin you can find a bridge. If one is
	  so inclined to look under the bridge when crossing they will find a troll with a note telling how he was a bad troll which allowed others to pass his bridge. This is a small and humourous reference to
	  the three billy goats gruff. Likewise in the next installment of the game <i>Skyrim</i> one can find a similar event. When traveling south into the mountians of Markarth there is a bridge one may chance
	  across.

	When first coming to the bridge there are three goats that scamper across, if one were to look under the bridge they will then find a dead troll. This is once again a reference to the Three Billy
	Goats Gruff. I found this interesting if only because the references were subtle and were a recurring theme in the series. As follows are the video clips for your viewing pleasure.
